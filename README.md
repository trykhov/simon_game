Simon Game Project

This is a project from my Udemy Web Development course where we implement jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in creating the Simon game.

I really enjoyed making this game because I was able to implement a lot of the jQuery that I learned in my lessons. One particular challenge that I came across but eventually overcame was keeping track of the user's choices per level. But after finding out that I just really needed to keep track of the last choice the user made and check that choice every time with the game's pattern, it made the project easier.

Here's a demo of how the game looks and works:
